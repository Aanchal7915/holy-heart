## Installation & Setup

   ```

3. The component is ready to use in your React application.

## Usage Example

```jsx
import BookAppointment from './pages/BookAppointment';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <BookAppointment />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

### Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be easily customized by:
- Modifying color schemes in the className props
- Adjusting spacing and layout
- Customizing animations and transitions

### API Endpoints
Update the `backendUrl` variable to point to your backend server:
```javascript
const backendUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND || "http://your-backend-url";
```

### Time Slots
Modify the time slot options in the reschedule modal or create a dynamic time slot generator based on your hospital's schedule.

## Security Considerations

- All API calls include authentication tokens
- Input validation on both client and server side
- XSS protection through proper data sanitization
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
